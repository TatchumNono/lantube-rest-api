# The Backend
The backend was developed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) using MVC as a design pattern.
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) was choosed as a database for the system and I used [Mongoose js](https://mongoosejs.com/), 
a library that facilitates the work with MongoDB.
The REST API was developed and tested using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
